a0.py : Solve the N-Queens or N-Rooks problem!
This program uses D Crandall's nrooks-2.py program as a basic version.

N-rooks problem is: Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N rooks on the board so that no rooks can take any other, i.e. such that no two rooks share the same row or column.

The N-Queens problem is: Given an empty NxN chessboard, place N Queens on the board so that no queens can take any other, i.e. such that no two queens share the same row or column or diagonal.

This program takes 4 argument: 
1. Problem type (nqueen/nrook) 
2. Number of queens/rooks to be placed. 
3. Row number of unavailable cell 
4. Col number of unavailable cell
